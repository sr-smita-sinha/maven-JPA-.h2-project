# Springboot-JPA-H2-database

This is a sample project in springboot and jpa(hibernate) using h2 database. 

**h2** is a in memory, open source, java database which uses temporary tables which gets flushed from memory, once the application stops.

> H2 queries are also similar to mysql, but very few changes in datatype such as float to real.
 
`Note: This is a h2 database implementation of the project i've developed`
